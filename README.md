I was motivated to build this game for two reasons. First, I wanted to test my new found knowledge of vanilla JavaScript, and secondly, because I grew up in the 90's and I'm extremely fond of the era. 

In the future, I would like to clean up some of the CSS and make it more mobile-friendly, as well as add phrases instead of only single words.
